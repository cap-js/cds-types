/**
 * The classes in here are used to work around naming conflicts with Node builtin types.

 * ```ts
 * const boolean: typeof boolean_

 * But we don't want to expose these classes to the user,
 * which would inevitably happen if they were part of linked/classes.d.ts
 * so we need stow them away in this internal module instead.
